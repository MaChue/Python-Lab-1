### How to Run the Application
  #### 1. Run on Computer
  * Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in your machine.
  * Install Tkinter **`pip3 install tk`**
  * Download the project zip file from [codio](https://codio.co.uk/mchue/python-lab-1) or from [github](https://github.com/MaChue/Python-Lab-1.git).
  * Path to project directory from the terminal application **`cd your_file_path/Python-Lab-1`**.
  * Type **`python3 main.py`** to run the Python program.

  #### 2. Run on Codio
  ##### a. Run from my codio [Phython Lab 1](https://codio.co.uk/mchue/python-lab-1) workspace.
  * Open Terminal **`Tools > Terminal`** from the codio navigation bar.
  * Type **`python3 main.py`** to run the Python program.
  * Open **`Virtual Desktop`** from the codio navigation bar to see application user interface.

  ##### b. Run from your own codio workspace
  * Go to your codio dashboard.
  * Click on **`My Project`** from the left navigation bar.
  * Click on **`New Project`** button from the top navigation bar.
  * Click on **`Click here`** link under the **`Select your starting Point`** option.
  * Select **`Import > SOURCE > Zip File > browse for files`** and select downloaded **`python-lab-1.zip`** file from your computer.
  * Finally, click **`Create`** button and you will see the project file is open in your codio workspace.
  * Install **`tkinter`** library from terminal **`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`**.
  * Before we run the program, we need to install **`X server`** software to enable Virtual Desktop in the codio environment.
  * Install **`X server`** from **`Tool > Install Software > X server`**.
  * After installation is finished, you will need to restart your codio workspace from **`Project > Restart Box`**.
  * Type **`python3 main.py`** to run the Python program.

  
### Features and Implementation
  ##### 1. Add New Contact
  - Add new person to Person table of **`address_book`** database.
  - Insert new person to existing persons list by using **`binary insertion sort algorithm`**.
  - Show sorted persons list on the main screen with newly added data.

  ##### 2. Edit Exiting Contact Data
  - Edit selected person data and save edited data back to database.
  - Sort existing person list by using **`insertion sort algorithm`**.
  - Show sorted and updated person list on the main screen
